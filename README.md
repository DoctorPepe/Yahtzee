# Yahtzee Gam
Basic Yahtzee game developed in Java as a computer science project.

This project is an exersize in the use of GitHub and Java. Issues are written as reminders for myself, if I ever wish to come back to it and polish it up. 

Disclaimer: I take no ownership of the game assets or the Yahtzee game or franchise. This application was created solely for educational purposes and not for profit.

[Dropped]: I have decided to archive this project

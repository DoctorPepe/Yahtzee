# Yahtzee Game (WIP)
Basic Yahtzee game developed in Java as a computer science project.

This project is an exersize in the use of GitHub and Java. Issues are written as reminders for myself, seeing a I will probably drop this project for a while and come back to it when I have time to troubleshoot scoring issues.
